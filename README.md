# TheNgadjiDrum

This piece is a VR experience developed and based on an artwork or artifact that exists in a museum. The artifact we chose is an African drum that has a spiritual and religious significance. The drum, like many similar objects of cultural value, was stolen by the British in the late 19th century. The experience we developed sheds light on the historical and heritage importance of this piece and the need for its return to its community.
